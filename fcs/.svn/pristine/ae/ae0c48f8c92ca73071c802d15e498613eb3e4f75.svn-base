Dear Manager,

 the problem (1), was due to uncompleted coding. I fixed it by completing all the sorting part code.

 the problem(2), was due to the binary search, in binary searching, we always need to sort the list first, then we can use binary search to find the item. I fixed it by using Linear Search instead. In Linear Searching, it does not matter if the searching space is sorted or not, we always search the item one by one.

 the problem(3), was due to the inefficiency of insertion sort, I fixed it by using a better sorting algorithm, which is Selection Sort.


 Kind regards, Luoyang Xing a1756195
